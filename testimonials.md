> I don't know if I've learned more about data mesh in any single conversation 
> than I did speaking with Ammara. And it was probably my ~200th conversation 
> and ~100th podcast interview on data mesh. She's thought through so many 
> aspects at a deep level, not just the tactical but the why behind the small 
> tactical decisions. Clear thoughts with good anecdotes and the high empathy
> data mesh requires. If you get a chance to speak with her on data mesh, take it!
